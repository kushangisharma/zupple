Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I recently worked on a practical coding assessment for the frontend developer intern role at Zupple Labs. Let me walk you through some key aspects:

Assumptions:
I made some assumptions to guide the project. For instance, the authorization key has a 10-character limit, and file uploads must not exceed 5 MB. These assumptions help prevent overloading the server with large payloads.

Tech Stack:
I used a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, and JS, with React JS and TypeScript powered by Vite. Material UI components, zod for form validation, and Axios for API calls played crucial roles.

Deployment Link:
You can check out the deployed project 
Form Validation - https://nimble-taffy-dc295e.netlify.app/
Blockchain Explorer - https://65afbd42b8bc710e1e758035--lucent-twilight-2fb288.netlify.app/
Screenshots:
I've included screenshots for both the Form Page and Blockchain Explore Page in various views (desktop and mobile). This should give you a visual overview.

Local Setup:
To get started locally, follow these steps:

Fork the repo.
Clone your fork.
Run npm install to set up dependencies.
Start the development server with npm run dev.
Additional Commands:
Some additional commands like npm run build and npm run lint are handy for various tasks.

Features:
Here are some notable features:

Form validation on submitting the form.
Functional pagination of transaction history.
Hash value copied to clipboard.
Modal displaying info about the blocks with a close button.

Feel free to explore the project and collaborate! If you want to set it up locally, the GitHub repository is where you can find everything.

Happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
